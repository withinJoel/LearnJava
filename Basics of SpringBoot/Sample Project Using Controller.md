* Made with by Joel Jolly.

## File Directory Pattern
```
src
 - main
    - java
      - com.example.login //Instead of `login` your project name.
          * AppController // You can name whatever you want but make sure you have `Controller` in that file name.
          * LoginApplication // Your default boilerplate code that is pregenerated by IdellJ.
    - resources
       - static
          * home.html
          * login.html
          * error.html
  - build.gradle
```
