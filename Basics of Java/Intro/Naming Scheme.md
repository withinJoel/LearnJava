Here are some examples and hints to help you remember:

Capitalize:

1. Class names:
    - Example: public class Greet { ... }
    - Hint: Think of a class as a "title" - it deserves capitalization!
2. Interfaces:
    - Example: public interface Printable { ... }
    - Hint: Interfaces are like contracts - they deserve respect (and capitalization)!
3. Enums:
    - Example: public enum Color { RED, GREEN, BLUE }
    - Hint: Enums are like special categories - they deserve capitalization!
4. Abstract classes:
    - Example: public abstract class Animal { ... }
    - Hint: Abstract classes are like "parents" - they deserve capitalization!

Lowercase:

1. Variable names:
    - Example: int userAge = 25;
    - Hint: Variables are like " nicknames" - they don't need capitalization!
2. Method names:
    - Example: public void printHello() { ... }
    - Hint: Methods are like "actions" - they don't need capitalization!
3. Package names:
    - Example: package com.example.myapp;
    - Hint: Packages are like "directories" - they don't need capitalization!

Remember:

- If it's a "thing" (class, interface, enum, abstract class), capitalize it!
- If it's a "action" or "nickname" (method, variable, package), lowercase it!

Hope this helps!
